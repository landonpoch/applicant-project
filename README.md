# ApplicantProject
Notes / excuses :)
 - The extra requirement I've opted for is code coverage (included in instructions)
 - Got a late start Sunday evening so didn't invest more time to improve (very minimalist)
 - Spent 4 hours total
 - I used a project starter that basically helps bootsrap
 - Unit tests, end to end tests, code coverage, live code reloading are all included in the starter template and can be expanded on
 - I looked at Laravel briefly and got it running on my machine but opted to stick with something more familiar due to time constraints
 - I haven't created a recorded demo yet but can do so if necessary after submission

Instructions:
 - Clone this repo
 - Install node (I was using v14.8.0)
 - Make sure you have the angular cli tools installed `npm install -g @angular/cli`
 - install all dependencies `npm install`
 - run backend api: `npm run api`
 - run frontend: `ng serve --open`
 - run tests: `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage`
